# Given an array of a million integers between zero and a billion, out of order, how can you efficiently sort it? Assume that you cannot store an array of a billion elements in memory.

    #   By not storing the whole list in memory but streaming its values instead
    #   andÂ then sorting buckets thereof, memory usage is 10x lower.
    
    #   Performance-wise, though, speed is significantly lower. Bucket-processing
    #   forces to perform several passess on the original list of items; although
    #   the memory usage in each pass is far smaller, the time spent on all those
    #   extra passes is far greater.
    
    #   Setting a higher bucket size helps; it dramatically decreases the number of
    #   passes, which is the most time-consuming step, while keeping the sorting
    #   time for each bucket constant and the memory usage to just 2x that of a
    #   bucket size 10**-2 smaller.
